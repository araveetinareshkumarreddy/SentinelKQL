## Microsoft Sentinel Overview Page Queries

The Overview Page in Microsoft Sentinel is intended to serve as a main dashboard and give a high-level of Sentinel main areas, including data collection, analytics, incidents, and automation.

This repo contains the queries behind the various Overview Page modules.

P.S. Some have asked why there are no queries supplied for the Analytics widget. The Analytics widget uses the API instead of a KQL query.
